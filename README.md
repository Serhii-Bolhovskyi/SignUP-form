# Sign Up Form

This is practice exercise, where you need to make Sign-Up Form. Which needed for any kind of products(like websites, applications, etc.). This impoves your coding skills by bulding realistic cases. Example from dribbble [Sign-Up form](https://dribbble.com/shots/21515691-Challenge-Intro-component-with-signup-form?utm_source=Clipboard_Shot&utm_campaign=dusvy_m&utm_content=Challenge-%20Intro%20component%20with%20signup%20form&utm_medium=Social_Share&utm_source=Clipboard_Shot&utm_campaign=dusvy_m&utm_content=Challenge-%20Intro%20component%20with%20signup%20form&utm_medium=Social_Share).

## Overview

### Task requirements

Users should be able to:

1. View the site's optimal layout based on their device's screen size.
1. All interactive elements on the page have hover states.
1. When you submit the form, you'll get an error message if:
    * There are no input fields available.
    * The email address is incorrectly formatted.

### Layout of sign-up

I created a folder `images`, where you can find a layout.
